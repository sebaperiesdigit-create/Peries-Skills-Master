## What This Skill Does

Given a proposed task, compares it against the current skill catalog in `.claude/skills/`
and recommends exactly one disposition: USE EXISTING, USE WITH PARAMETERS, EXTEND
EXISTING, COMBINE EXISTING SKILLS, CREATE NEW, or ESCALATE.

This skill is **read-only and chat-only**. It never creates, edits, renames, moves, or
deletes anything, and never acts on its own recommendation — building, extending, or
combining skills always requires a separate, explicit follow-up request.

## Input

`$ARGUMENTS` is the proposed task description.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is missing or too vague to compare against the catalog, ask exactly one
focused clarifying question before proceeding (e.g. "What should this task do, and what
would trigger it?").

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Validate the input.** If `$ARGUMENTS` is missing or too vague, ask exactly one
   focused clarifying question, then proceed using the answer.

2. **Discover and shortlist.** Glob `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`. Read only the
   frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `argument-hint`) of each discovered skill.
   Shortlist any skill whose frontmatter plausibly overlaps the proposed task — by
   function, synonym, or expected input/output, not just exact wording.

3. **Sanity-check against CLAUDE.md.** If CLAUDE.md exists and contains a skill
   inventory table, cross-reference it against what Step 2 actually found on disk. If
   CLAUDE.md and `.claude/skills/` disagree (a skill documented but missing, or present
   but undocumented), report the drift and trust the actual `SKILL.md` files as source
   of truth — do not silently pick one.

4. **Deep-read the shortlist.** Read the full `SKILL.md` content only for the
   shortlisted plausible matches — not every skill in the catalog.

5. **Compare.** For each shortlisted skill, compare its actual scope, inputs, workflow,
   outputs, parameters, and guardrails against the proposed task. Note the matched
   capability and the important gap, if any.

6. **Assign exactly one disposition**, using this priority order (highest first — stop
   at the first one that applies):
   1. **USE EXISTING** — a shortlisted skill is a complete match; no changes needed.
   2. **USE WITH PARAMETERS** — a shortlisted skill fully covers the task once given
      different arguments/input; no content change needed.
   3. **COMBINE EXISTING SKILLS** — two or more shortlisted skills, used together
      unmodified, collectively cover the complete workflow.
   4. **EXTEND EXISTING** — a shortlisted skill must be changed (new steps, fields, or
      capability) to cover the task.
   5. **CREATE NEW** — no existing skill, combination, or reasonable extension
      adequately covers the task.
   6. **ESCALATE** — evidence is insufficient or contradictory, or the decision
      requires a human call on permissions, ownership, risk, or scope.

7. **Report.** Present the findings and disposition in chat only. Never write a file.

## Output Format

```
# Skill Fit Report: [task description]

## Understood Task
[one-line restatement of the proposed task]

## Shortlisted Candidates
| Skill | SKILL.md path | Why shortlisted |
|---|---|---|
| ... | ... | ... |

## Comparison
| Candidate skill | Relevant SKILL.md path | Matched capability | Important gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Catalog Drift
[mismatch between CLAUDE.md's skill inventory and .claude/skills/, or "None found"]

## Disposition: [USE EXISTING / USE WITH PARAMETERS / COMBINE EXISTING SKILLS / EXTEND EXISTING / CREATE NEW / ESCALATE]
[evidence-based justification, 2-4 sentences, citing the specific skill(s) and the
match/gap that drove the decision]
```

## Notes

- Read-only and chat-only: never creates, edits, renames, moves, or deletes anything
  under `.claude/skills/`; never modifies CLAUDE.md; never saves the report to a file.
- Does not scan `output/` folders — those hold results, not reusable skill definitions.
- Never acts on its own recommendation. Building, extending, or combining skills always
  requires a separate, explicit follow-up request (e.g. via `skill-builder`).
- Shortlist by frontmatter first; only read full `SKILL.md` content for plausible
  matches — don't read the entire catalog in full on every run.
- Apply the disposition priority order strictly, top to bottom, to keep
  recommendations consistent across runs.
- Runs directly in the main conversation (no subagent fork) since Step 1 may need to
  pause and ask the user a clarifying question before continuing.
